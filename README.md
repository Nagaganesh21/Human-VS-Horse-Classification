# Human-Horse Image Classifier

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of an image classifier using computer vision techniques to distinguish between human and horse images. Python and OpenCV are utilized to create a custom image processing model for accurate human-horse image classification.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing a variety of images, including both human and horse images. This dataset is crucial for training and testing the image classifier.

## Project Tasks

In this project, We Did:

1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its content and structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for training by addressing any missing data and performing necessary transformations.

3. **Model Development**: Create a custom image processing model using OpenCV and Python to accurately classify human and horse images.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Train and evaluate the image classifier on the dataset to assess its classification performance.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop a reliable image classifier that can effectively distinguish between human and horse images. This classifier can have practical applications in various fields, including image recognition and classification tasks.
